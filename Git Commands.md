## Git Commands for Git Workshop

### Task 1: Initialize a New Repository, Create Files, and Make Commits

1. Create a new project folder and initialize a Git repository: <br>Use "git init" in the terminal, in the path to the project folder you wish to add.

2. Create a few files with different content: <br> I used the "wsl echo "Hello World!" > helloworld.txt" command.

3. Stage and commit the files with descriptive messages: <br> Used the "git add ." to add the entire folder to the staged area. You can also add "git add "filename"" to add a certain file.<br> Used the "git commit -m "First commit" to commit the files in the staged area.
